# Setup Guide - WERESL Firebase Application

## ðŸš€ Quick Start (After npm install)

### 1. **Firebase Configuration** âœ… Already Done
The application is already configured with your Firebase project:
- Project ID: `weresldatabase`
- Firestore Database: Enabled
- Storage: Using Google Drive instead (free)

### 2. **Google Drive Setup** (Optional for now)
The application currently uses a fallback service that simulates Google Drive uploads. For full functionality:

#### Option A: Use Fallback (Recommended for testing)
- The app will work with placeholder URLs
- Images will be processed but not actually uploaded
- Perfect for testing the application

#### Option B: Set up Google Drive API (For production)
1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Create a new project or select existing
3. Enable Google Drive API
4. Create credentials (API Key and OAuth 2.0 Client ID)
5. Update `src/services/googleDrive.js` with your credentials

### 3. **Add Logo Image** (Optional)
Create a logo image for the application:
```bash
# Add your logo to the public folder
cp your-logo.png public/logo.png
```

### 4. **Start the Application**
```bash
npm run dev
```

The application will start at `http://localhost:3000`

- Same district mapping system

### **Validation Logic**
- Replicates all validation from `code.gs`
- Same error handling and logging
- Same business rules for payments

### **Image Handling**
- Uses the same Google Drive folder: `1l8yBRcK_QHMSjrdxwYHgVjwyBSM`
- Same HEIC conversion and compression
- Same file naming convention

## ðŸš¨ **Important Notes**

### **Firebase Security Rules**
For development, the app uses open rules. For production, update Firestore rules:
```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    match /{document=**} {
      allow read, write: if true; // Change for production
    }
  }
}
```

### **Google Drive Integration**
Currently using fallback mode. For full functionality:
1. Set up Google Drive API credentials
2. Update `src/services/googleDrive.js`
3. Replace `fallbackDriveService` with `googleDriveService`

### **Environment Variables** (Optional)
Create `.env` file for custom configuration:
```
VITE_GOOGLE_DRIVE_FOLDER_ID=1l8yBRcK_QHMSjrdxwYHgVjwyBSM
VITE_GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_api_key
VITE_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
```
